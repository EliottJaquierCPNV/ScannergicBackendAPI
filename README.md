### General idea of the project

Our idea is to develop an android application which would allow people with allergies to fill them in the app, scan the barcode of a product and quickly know if they can eat the product or not. So the application knows, according to the different allergies, which product can be eaten or not. To do this, the android app will be requesting the allergies contained in the product to an API.

### Goal

This application aims at simplifying people with allergies' life allowing them to quickly know if they can eat a product or not.

### Used technologies

API : ASP.NET / C#

HMI (Human Machine Interface) : 

Database : MySQL
